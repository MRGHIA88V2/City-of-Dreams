![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

## How to use [Wannabe Edgerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5646)

## Info

- New stat - Humanity, which depends on installed cyberware usage and committed kills.
- Possible Cyberpsychosis when humanity becomes very low.
- Cyberware Humanity usage based on implants type and quality
- New consumables called Neuroblockers which should help you to manage Humanity.
- New widgets to track your current Humanity value.
- Mod Settings menu


## Humanity

Adds new stat - **Humanity**, which depends on installed cyberware usages and committed kills. Cyberware usages and enemy kills decrease this stat temporarily so you can restore it after sleeping at your bed or doing a few other apartment interactions like having a shower etc. You can track your current Humanity value via Cyberware menu screen or with a new widget which will appear above the player's HP bar.

There are a three status effects which this mod uses depending on your Humanity stat:

**Low Humanity:** adds some visual glitches and a few combat related debuffs to your character, also can trigger a **Cyberpsychosis** with some chance. It's better to take **Neuroblockers** or go to sleep at this stage.

**Cyberpsychosis:** 
launches heavier visual glitches but buffs your movement speed, armor value and health regeneration, and if your character is not in an interior or dangerous area then triggers police spawn as well. If related option is enabled, then you will be teleported to one of the 20+ predefined locations when **Cyberpsychosis** effect ends. Teleporting logic does not support Dogtown yet.

**Post-Psychosis:** debuffs your combat skills, decreases damage resistances and blocks any cyberware usage until the next rest in your bed. Humanity loss is freezed and **Cyberpsychosis** can't be triggered at this stage.

Actions which restore your **Humanity:**
- Sleeping in your bed (fully restores Humanity).
- Petting a cat or iguana.
- Taking a shower.
- Donating money to a homeless
apartment interactions (playing a guitar, using a record player etc.)


## Neuroblockers

**Neuroblockers** is a new consumable which removes low Humanity side-effects and freezes Humanity points loss while active. You can buy it at some **Ripperdocs**, plus **Neuroblockers** crafting recipe was added to a few medical shops.

**Common Neuroblockers:** Instant Implants, Cassius, Bucks' Clinic.

**Uncommon** Neuroblockers: Fingers M.D., Octavio's Clinic.

**Rare Neuroblockers:** Kraviz's Clinic, Viktor's Clinic.

If the clipping occurs with and without the mod, then you need to contact the authors of the items.

Drinking and eating will also apply their respective effects (drunk, well fed, sated) if you had a matching food type in your inventory, if not it is a purely cosmetic action.
The consumption of alcohol/softdrinks/food from your inventory always starts with the cheapest items, they all give the same buffs anyway.
Alcohol/food props are randomly selected for the animation.
The smoking animation loops forever. To stop it, simply try to move (forward/back/left/right etc)

The menu will also not work when controlling surveilance systems, in Brain Dances, and shouldn't work in Johnny's memories either.
If you do have/use the option while in conversation with NPCs just be aware that it can sometimes cause NPCs to sound distant/quiet during the animation(s)

There are 5 loadout slots. You can rename the title of each slot by clicking on the title and typing with a keyboard. You can't edit the text with a gamepad, but otherwise the mod works fine with gamepad.

## How to use

<summary>How to use TANSTAAFL</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

## How to use [TANSTAAFL PT1](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10039?tab=description)

## Info
- Part 1 introduces the Vehicle Insurance systems into the game. 
- Part 2 introduces the Life Insurance systems into the game.

## Info Part 1

**Vehicle Insurance system rules:**

- Fast Travel is a paid service. No money - no travel.
- Vehicle summoning and repair are paid services: no money - no cars; and if you get in debt with the system, they will deny you access to your vehicles until you repay your debts.
- You are charged for traffic accidents depending on which car you hit.
- An important difference from other similar mods - those are not flat numbers, prices are calculated based on fast travel distance, vehicle price, and your possible discounts. It’s on you to decide whether or not you want to risk your fancy car or grab an old rusty one depending on the potential dangers you might face.
- Another important difference of this mod: you gain access to the Vehicle Insurance website through your home PC where you can buy different subscription packages to have a discount on all the vehicle-related services. Those aren’t cheap, but without those discounts prices are biting!
- In the works: more means to get data on your current subscription state (phone messages).

# How to use [TANSTAAFL PT2](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/10569)

## Info Part 2

**Life Insurance system rules:**

- The mod is activated when you sleep in your bed for the first time, so you can start a new playthrough with it - you will have normal saves and checkpoints during the tutorial.
- When the system is active, you can no longer save at will - manual saves are only available when you are in the vicinity of your home bed (seeing the “go to sleep” dialog line).
- Sleeping creates an auto-save point and updates your last home location for the Trauma Team.
- You can buy a Life Insurance subscription at your home PC which gives you X amount of paid resurrections and Y amount of emergency beacons.
- You can place an emergency beacon to create a temporary revival point - this point is reset after you sleep in your bed.
- If you die during an open-world sequence you will be revived at the last beacon or home position.
- If you don’t have enough money to pay for revival or your subscription has expired, you will be revived at Trauma Team Medical Center and you will lose a substantial amount of money.
- If you die during a restrictive quest sequence, you will only be revived if you have an active emergency beacon placed. Otherwise, you will need to reload your last save.
