<summary>My Clothes are Clipping</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

There are a few reasons for this.

Female V
- 98 per cent of clothing is fitted to the Custom Fem V body we use.
If some clothes are clipping its because
- You are trying to fit Male V clothes to fem V.
- One Mod may have some clothing that fit and some that clip. As we can't separate some items in a single Mod this is just how it is.
- **Note** at this time not all Phantom Liberty clothing has been refitted for Fem V

Male V
- If you have enabled the Adonis body and clothes are clipping this is because you didn't enable the Refitted Adonis clothing from the optional Mods.
- If you do choose the Adonis body not all clothes are suited to that body so you will find some clip and some dont. This is also out of our control.
