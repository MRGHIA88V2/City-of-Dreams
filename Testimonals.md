"Since there isn't any 2024 reviews heres mine:

Soooo I have been constantly streaming Cyberpunk 2077 Nomad run using the Lite version of V2 (mostly because I try to not include anything lewd... Or too lewd) ANYWAY, the collection was very easy to install and has all the great mods already there for me. Not only is the support great but so too are the mods and V2 themselves, I have used other collections but I am yet to redo Starfield mods. In any case, the fact that suggestions are taken onboard but it feels like a community effort.

If I was to rate this out of 10 it would be a 20, I very rarely leave reviews buuuut I figured this year I will change that since it does help game devs/modders, I will also say the fact that I can add more mods to the lite version is also amazing ^^ Just glad to be apart of the community even though I am very quiet and find it hard to communicate but just wanna say thank you for these collections and thank you to the modders who made the game even better than what it is"

"Now that I've finally been able to play around with it and what can I say, it's great, it's a brilliant mod pack. Everything works pretty much seamlessly and the changes are noticeable from the get go.  It's helped me get back into the game and do a whole new playthrough. 

Another big portion I think should be mentioned is the community behind this as well, this is probably one of the friendliest and chill servers I've been in on Discord, with the support and testing team being absolute beasts and because of them installing a pack with over 1000 mods couldn't be simpler. You guys are all grand and I hope to see this pack flourish even further into the future."

"I'm new to CP modding, decided to give one of the collections ago as I've spent more time modding the likes of fallout games and Skyrim than I'd like to admit. I settled on City of Dreams (Heavy) as I could see how well supported it was from the documentation and this discord. Install was a breeze the documentation covered every question I had throughout and all completed easily.
It runs far better out of the box than I expected, modded with nearly 1000 mods I'm playing with more frames than I could on CP release on the same system. The game feels so much better! Y'all have done an amazing job with the extra content and eye candy + fixing all the things I didn't like upon release. Great work and a massive thankyou!!! +++"

### OUSEN:

"I just wanted to take the time to thank you, V2, for the effort you put into creating this modlist and for the incredible gaming experience it has provided. It brings me much closer to the gaming experience I always wanted to have with Vanilla.

 People probably don't realize the time and work it takes to find the right functional balance with so many mods. 

This modlist offers a unique and customizable gaming experience that has reignited my love for the game. I used to enjoy Night City a lot, and this modlist gives it a refreshing twist.

I also want to mention the work put into writing installation guides and tutorials, which are equally well-crafted with clear and concise explanations.

And one more thing, I haven't mentioned yet, but I also want to highlight the kindness and constant support present on this Discord community. Of course, I'm grateful to V2, but also to Fenrir, who took the time to answer my countless questions in recent days.

With that said, I must go now, I have a city to burn."

### Fenrir:

"Seeing you succeed like this with a big collection is impressive. But being here with you on your journey just on the side is huge for a little nobody like myself. 

I remember when I told you that this collection will grow fast and I see new names here very often, just like I suspected. It‚Äôs an awesome collection with awesome people. 

HUGE respect to V2 for giving us his time to fix this collection with 700+ mods to work with so little issues is just AWESOME."

### Fronky-Bot:

I'd also like to thank V2 for including a couple of my mods in the collection, and quite literally skyrocketing the downloads on them xD

### relentless81:

"Thanks for all  the effort involved to make this collection. I have been enjoying it so far. Its hard sometimes to find collections that work with no issues but this one is top notch!! Great work."

### Jinxy ùì©ùì∏ùì∂ùì´ùì≤ùìÆ Hyperdrive:

"I would like to preface this by first of all thanking the lead behind this collection V2. And all their efforts for maintaining what often can be described as a rather complex and time consuming process, maintaining a collection of mods with a database this large is no easy task, but the dedication and willingness of this individual has made City of Dreams a "Go to" Collection for many, including myself . And with the ease of which the collection has worked as well.

I would also like to thank the staff of this discord for their dedication and expertise in helping solve a plethora of technical issues users can often experience, such is the nature of modding and pc's. Which it itself is no easy feat when you're dealing with potentially hundreds if not thousands of different PC configurations. 

Thank you also to the countless modders that without them would not make these collections possible at all. Their countless hours of testing and dedication to hundreds and hundreds of mods, and all for the love and passion of modding and sharing with the community. Making Cyberpunk even more enjoyable for us all. 

Thank you to CD Projekt RED for developing this game, and thank you to them for sticking with it and constantly improving the game over the course of time since it's launch, for without them no one us may even be here gathered today.

And also finally a thank you to the discord community for being helpful and pleasant and making the discord a great place for all to gather and talk and about share mods etc."

"Just finished my first CP 2077 playthrough and just wanted to thank V2 and the excellent team on discord for the best mod collection I have every used. This was the smoothest modding I have ever had. I also used the Starfield collection which was also great. Keep it up guys. V2 collection or nothing IMO"

### Spartandestroyr:
"I‚Äôve only recently stumbled across your cyberpunk collection and before that I never even thought about trying to mod cyberpunk cause it seemed way too complicated but I gave your collection a try and can‚Äôt be happier. I had a few hiccups at first but that was mostly on my end just trying to figure things out but since then I‚Äôve had tons of fun the collection definitely breathed new life into cyberpunk. Now you‚Äôve gone and done it again with starfield! Ive really enjoyed what you have done so far and look forward to seeing this collection grow and blossom into the greatest collection of mods ever assembled. Thank you for all you and everyone else involved so for us. You definitely made modding fun again."
